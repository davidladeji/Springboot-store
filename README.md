# Spring Boot Core Concepts Project

This project is a hands-on implementation of foundational Spring Boot concepts, inspired by comprehensive training content. It focuses on mastering dependency injection, bean lifecycle, configuration management, and data persistence using Spring Data JPA.

## Key Features

- Dependency Injection and Bean Lifecycle management  
- Application Context and Configuration  
- Data persistence with Spring Data JPA  
- Entity relationships with custom query methods  
- Advanced querying techniques: projections, pagination, specification-based filtering  
- Clean, layered architecture for maintainability and scalability  

## Technologies Used

- Java 17  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring Data JPA  
- MySQL
- Maven

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo  
2. Configure your database settings in `application.yml`  
3. Build and run the application with your preferred method (`mvn spring-boot:run` or IDE run configuration)  
4. Explore the domain models and repositories to understand relationships and queries  

## Notes

This project was developed as part of a structured learning path to refresh and deepen Spring Boot fundamentals, bridging the gap between theory and real-world application.
